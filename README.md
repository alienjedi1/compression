## Phase system
The compression system uses a phase system - each phase consisting of different algorithms and steps.

#### Phase 1 - English Words
Phase 1 replaces English words (of a certain length) with a shorter string, preserving bytes.

#### Phase 2 - Irregular Pattern Detection
Phase 2 uses an algorithm to detect patterns not visible to the human eye.
